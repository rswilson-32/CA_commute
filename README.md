This data set contains data on modes of transportation to work for Californian Residents aged 16 years and older. Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey.

According to the source, "Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States," with cars being by far the most used mode of transportation. While cars are convenient, they are one of the deadliest modes of transportation and release harmful emissions into the atmosphere. According to the <a href = "https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/">California Air Resources Board </a>, vehicles and cars account for approximately one-third of all of California's CO2 emissions and air pollutants. 

Besides driving, commuters can take public transportation, bike, walk, work from home, or even carpool. All of these methods help take cars off of our roads, which can significantly cut emissions and save money.

This project was great practice with R and the tidyverse tools. I am more confident in working with geographical data and data visualization.

For this project, we will look at the distributions of Californians that prefer each mode of transportation for work on the county and city level. 

It's important to note that this data only includes Californians aged 16 years or older that commute to paid work.
This data set was accessed from the <a href = "https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/transportation-to-work-2000-2006-2010/resource/87fa0619-708a-4d92-ba5d-879df338b46e">California Health and Human Services Open Data Website </a>. They provided amazing data dictionaries, narrative examples, research sources, and so much more.

<a href = "https://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html">Eric C. Andersonâ€™s github repository </a> on making maps in R was an incredible source. I used this reference for all of my ggplot maps.

I used this <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_California">Wikipedia article on Californian counties </a> for more great background information and its tables.
